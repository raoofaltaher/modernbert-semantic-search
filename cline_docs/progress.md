# Progress Status

## What Works (Based on README Features)

-   **Core Semantic Search:** Implemented and functional, using ModernBERT embeddings and Milvus for search.
-   **Data Ingestion:** Script exists (`ingest_data.py`) to process data, generate embeddings, and load into Milvus. Includes batching and title file generation.
-   **Backend API:** FastAPI server setup, serves `/search` and `/suggestions` endpoints. Includes configuration loading, model loading, Milvus connection handling (`lifespan`), and error handling.
-   **Frontend UI:** React/Vite/TypeScript application exists. Includes:
    -   Search bar component (`SearchBar.tsx`).
    -   Results display component (`ResultsList.tsx`) with expandable abstracts.
    -   Type-ahead suggestions using `rapidfuzz` via the backend.
    -   Loading indicators (`Spin`).
    -   Error feedback (`message`).
    -   Theme switching (Light/Dark) with persistence (`localStorage`).
    -   Basic styling and layout using Ant Design and custom CSS.
-   **Milvus Integration:** Setup via Docker, collection creation, indexing (`AUTOINDEX`), and querying (`COSINE` similarity) are implemented.
-   **Configuration:** `.env` files are used for backend and frontend settings.

## What's Left to Build / Potential Next Steps

*(Based on initial setup, no specific pending tasks identified from README)*

-   Further testing and validation of search relevance across different query types.
-   Potential UI/UX refinements beyond the current Ant Design implementation.
-   Scalability testing for larger datasets.
-   More sophisticated error handling or logging.
-   Adding features like filtering, pagination, or user accounts (if desired).
-   Deployment strategy beyond local development setup.

## Progress Status

-   **Core functionality:** Implemented.
-   **Memory Bank:** Initialized.
-   **Project Status:** Ready for further development or specific tasks based on the established foundation.
